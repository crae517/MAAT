# MAAT
Materials analysis applying thermodynamic (MAAT) software: A friendly and free tool to analyze the formation of solid solutions, amorphous phases and intermetallic compounds


Installation: 
To use MAAT, two different pathways may be used. The first one consists to download the code from Datasets in Mendeley MAAT.m, this code could be compiled directly from in MATLAB 2019b forward. For correct execution of this code, the MATLAB packages Statistical and Machine Learning ToolboxTM and Curve Fitting ToolboxTM will be required. Additionally, two additional sets of programs will be used: “Ternary Plots” [1] and “All Permutations of integers with sum criteria”[2]. These packages may be downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral. After all the required files have been downloaded and put into the same folder, the MAAT.m code could be run using MATLAB.
The second option is to use the graphical user interface. For this purpose, the user must download the MAAT installation file from the web page https://www.rpm.usm.cl/download. MATLAB  2019b or any version of MATLAB is not necessary for the correct execution of MAAT. MAAT will be run directly through the MAAT executable file.
